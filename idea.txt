# **AetherLedger**

## 🌍 **Final Project Name:** **AetherLedger – Carbon Mapping & Predictive Air Defense**

### 🧭 **Tagline:**

*"Track your emissions. Predict their path. Protect your people."*

---

## 🔥 **New Description:**

**AetherLedger** is an AI-powered platform that tracks individual or organizational **carbon emissions**, and—using satellite-derived wind and pollution data—**predicts where those emissions will go.** It then recommends where to **deploy air purification measures (like green filters, moss walls, or ionizers)** to *intercept* that carbon impact **before it harms vulnerable populations.**

You can think of it as:

> 🧮 CarbonLedger: “How much damage am I doing?”
> 
> 
> 🛰️ *AirShield (with satellite forecasting)*: “Where will it do the most harm?”
> 
> 🌿 *AetherLedger*: “How can I intercept it and protect the environment?”
>

## 🛰️ **Key Tech Features:**

### 1. 🧮 **Emission Input & Footprint Calculator**

- Users input lifestyle or company behavior (transport, energy, etc.)
- Dashboard calculates monthly CO₂ emissions and equivalent health impact

### 2. 🌫️ **Satellite-Powered Dispersion Forecast**

- Uses mock Sentinel-5P satellite data + wind direction/speed + terrain to simulate where carbon and pollutants will **travel** over the next 24–72 hours
- Shows predicted **pollution impact zones** on an interactive map

### 3. 🌱 **Filter Deployment Advisor**

- Recommends **exact locations** to:
    - Plant trees or air-purifying plants (eco filters)
    - Install moss walls or low-cost filters in schools/hospitals
    - Create mini low-emission buffer zones
- Prioritizes **low-income or high-risk communities**

---

## 🤖 Optional AI Agents:

- **Dispersion AI**: Forecasts movement of CO₂ clouds and assigns exposure risk by area
- **Filter Bot**: Suggests cost-effective, location-specific air quality interventions
- **ESG Coach**: Advises individuals/companies on reducing emissions + boosting social responsibility

## 💼 Why It’ll Impress *These* Judges:

| Judge | Why They’ll Love It |
| --- | --- |
| **Finance (Judge 1)** | Quantified ROI from pollution mitigation + carbon offset credits |
| **SaaS (Judge 2)** | Perfectly scalable B2B product for smart cities or ESG platforms |
| **Cyber/Forensics (Judge 3)** | High-value geo-intelligence for law enforcement, health planning, and infrastructure defense |

---

## ✅ Feasibility MVP (in 5–7 hours):

### **Data**: Use mock carbon emission zones + wind flow vectors (static images or simple JS simulation)

### **Tools**: Leaflet.js for mapping, satellite overlays (static), form inputs, local JSON

### **MVP Focus**:

- Carbon input form
- Map with “predicted emission path”
- Location suggestions for filter placement
- Simple AI agent suggesting one action

---

## 🌟 Unique Edge:

You’re not just detecting air quality — **you’re predicting its damage path and intercepting it**. No one else in the room will show that.

## **AetherLedger — 5-Hour MVP Development Roadmap**

> 🎯 Goal: Build a functioning demo that shows:
> 
> - Carbon emission input
> - Predictive emission dispersion using mock satellite/wind data
> - Smart suggestions for filter placement
> - ESG-style feedback from a simple AI advisor

---

### ✅ **Hour 1: Project Setup + UI Framework**

- Set up folder structure, repo (optional GitHub init)
- Use **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** or **React** (if your team prefers components)
- Create 3 basic pages or sections:
    - 📄 Emission Input
    - 🗺️ Predictive Map
    - 💡 Suggestions Panel

---

### ✅ **Hour 2: Carbon Footprint Calculator**

- Form inputs: transport habits, electricity use, business activity, etc.
- Store inputs in variables or local JSON
- Show output:
    - Estimated **kg CO₂/month**
    - Equivalents (e.g., “= 5 trees needed to offset”)
- Style it like an **ESG dashboard card**

---

### ✅ **Hour 3: Dispersion Map (Mock Satellite Prediction)**

- Use **Leaflet.js** or **Mapbox** to display a city or country map
- Add **mock carbon source** pin from form input
- Overlay a **dispersion pattern**:
    - Use a static heatmap image or transparent polygons to simulate spread
    - Direction/size depends on a “wind vector” (preset values)

🛰️ *Tip:* Use arrows or animated lines to simulate carbon drift from source point

---

### ✅ **Hour 4: Smart Filter Deployment Suggestions**

- Based on dispersion zones, recommend:
    - “Place filters here: School A, Clinic B”
    - “Plant trees along X corridor”
- Use mock coordinates and names for schools/clinics in the path
- Display list or overlay icons on the map (🌳, 🏥)

---

### ✅ **Hour 5: AI Agent + Polish**

- Add a simple **rule-based AI advisor**:
    - Input: total CO₂, dispersion impact
    - Output: “Consider reducing car trips by 30% to halve your risk zone”
- Optional: add chat-style UI for this
- Final pass for mobile responsiveness, demo clicks, and presentation polish

---

## 🎁 Bonus (If time allows):

- Add “Compare before vs. after filters” toggle on map
- Downloadable PDF summary of user’s carbon + dispersion + actions

---

## 🧩 Tools Checklist:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
